Hi there, 

On my recent trip to San Francisco, California, I was surprised to find out that some things are really expensive out there. In this guide, I'm going to show you how to save up money when travelling to the land of the free.

# Before going to the USA

1. Get an [eSIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM).

You'll need a good **mobile internet connection**, and guess what? You can have internet + calls for FREE with a eSIM, as there are several companies offering trials. Please note that in order to use a trial, you must have an eSIM capable device and sign up for Verizon using eSIM. I was using an iPhone 14 Pro Max and I only tested Visible by Verizon and Google Fi. I highly recommend Visible as it's for 15 days, while Google Fi for only 7. Here some of the best offers:

**Visible by Verizon Get 15 days of Visible, for free. No credit card required.**
